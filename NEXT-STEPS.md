## 🎯 **IMMEDIATE NEXT STEP: Testing & Environment Setup**

### **1. Environment Configuration** (30 minutes)
```bash
# Add to .env.local
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_key_here
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here  # If using OpenAI models

# Verify Supabase is configured
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=your_service_key
```

### **2. Test the Multi-Agent System** (15 minutes)
```bash
# 1. Start the development server
pnpm run dev

# 2. Navigate to workflows
http://localhost:3000/workflows

# 3. Click "🤖 AI Builder" button

# 4. Test with these sample prompts:
"Create an expense approval workflow with manager review and QuickBooks integration"
"Build a customer onboarding process with email verification and Salesforce contact creation"
"Design a document approval workflow with multiple stakeholders and notifications"
```

### **3. Verify Agent Coordination** (10 minutes)
- **Check Agent Status Monitor**: Should show all 5 agents
- **Test Real-time Validation**: Try the validation tab
- **Monitor Agent Responses**: Each agent should provide specialized feedback
