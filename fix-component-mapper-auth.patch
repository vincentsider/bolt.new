// Patch for component-mapper.ts to handle authentication properly

// The issue is that we're using anon key which enforces RLS
// But we're not providing any user context, so the RLS policies are blocking access

// Option 1: Use service role key (if valid)
// Change in app/lib/.server/supabase.ts:
// supabaseServiceKey = context.cloudflare.env.SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY

// Option 2: Modify the RLS policy to allow anon access for reading
// Run this SQL in Supabase:
/*
-- Allow anonymous read access to component definitions
CREATE POLICY "Allow anonymous read access to components"
  ON component_definitions FOR SELECT
  TO anon
  USING (active = true);

-- Allow anonymous read access to component libraries  
CREATE POLICY "Allow anonymous read access to libraries"
  ON component_libraries FOR SELECT
  TO anon
  USING (active = true);
*/

// Option 3: Pass user context from the request
// In api.workflow-chat-v2.ts, get the user session and pass it to ComponentLoader

// For now, let's use Option 2 since it's the simplest
