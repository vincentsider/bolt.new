# Multi-Agent Architecture Foundation for WorkflowHub

## Overview

This document outlines the multi-agent architecture foundation for WorkflowHub using the OpenAI Agents SDK for TypeScript. Based on the requirements identified in `tasks.md`, we need to implement specialized AI agents to match Clark's approach and provide superior workflow automation capabilities.

## OpenAI Agents SDK Integration

### Installation

```bash
npm install @openai/agents
npm install @openai/agents-extensions
```

### Core Concepts

The OpenAI Agents SDK provides:
- **Agent Orchestration**: Coordinated multi-agent workflows
- **Agent Handoffs**: Specialized agents can transfer control to other agents
- **Tool Integration**: Agents can use custom tools and external APIs
- **Realtime Capabilities**: Voice and streaming interactions
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with Zod validation

- Optimize agent resource usage

## Architecture Implementation

### Agent Handoff System

```typescript
import { Agent, run, tool } from '@openai/agents';
import { z } from 'zod';

// Security Agent with validation tools
const securityTool = tool({
  name: 'validate_security',
  description: 'Validate security compliance of workflow components',
  parameters: z.object({ 
    component: z.string(),
    permissions: z.array(z.string())
  }),
  execute: async (input) => {
    // Security validation logic
    return `Security validation completed for ${input.component}`;
  },
});

const securityAgent = new Agent({
  name: 'Security Agent',
  instructions: 'You validate security and compliance of workflow components',
  handoffDescription: 'Handles all security validation and compliance checking',
  tools: [securityTool],
});

// Design Agent with UI tools
const designTool = tool({
  name: 'validate_design',
  description: 'Ensure UI components follow design system guidelines',
  parameters: z.object({ 
    componentType: z.string(),
    brandGuidelines: z.object({})
  }),
  execute: async (input) => {
    // Design validation logic
    return `Design validation completed for ${input.componentType}`;
  },
});

const designAgent = new Agent({
  name: 'Design Agent',
  instructions: 'You ensure UI consistency and design system compliance',
  handoffDescription: 'Handles all UI design and brand consistency requirements',
  tools: [designTool],
});

// Integration Agent with Arcade.dev tools
const integrationTool = tool({
  name: 'validate_integration',
  description: 'Validate external system integrations and permissions',
  parameters: z.object({ 
    integration: z.string(),
    permissions: z.array(z.string()),
    credentials: z.object({})
  }),
  execute: async (input) => {
    // Integration validation logic
    return `Integration validation completed for ${input.integration}`;
  },
});

const integrationAgent = new Agent({
  name: 'Integration Agent',
  instructions: 'You handle external system integrations and real-time permission validation',
  handoffDescription: 'Manages all external integrations, OAuth flows, and permission validation',
  tools: [integrationTool],
});

// Quality Agent with code review tools
const qualityTool = tool({
  name: 'review_code',
  description: 'Review generated workflow code for bugs and best practices',
  parameters: z.object({ 
    code: z.string(),
    language: z.string(),
    framework: z.string()
  }),
  execute: async (input) => {
    // Code review logic
    return `Code review completed for ${input.language} workflow`;
  },
});

const qualityAgent = new Agent({
  name: 'Quality Agent',
  instructions: 'You review generated code for bugs, performance, and best practices',
  handoffDescription: 'Handles code review, bug detection, and quality assurance',
  tools: [qualityTool],
});

// Main Orchestration Agent
const orchestrationAgent = Agent.create({
  name: 'Workflow Orchestration Agent',
  instructions: `You coordinate workflow building by delegating to specialized agents:
    - Security Agent: For security validation and compliance
    - Design Agent: For UI consistency and design guidelines  
    - Integration Agent: For external system connections
    - Quality Agent: For code review and bug detection
    
    Always ensure all agents collaborate to create secure, well-designed, properly integrated workflows.`,
  handoffs: [securityAgent, designAgent, integrationAgent, qualityAgent],
});
```

### Agent Coordination Workflow

```typescript
// Main workflow building function
async function buildWorkflowWithAgents(userRequest: string) {
  const result = await run(orchestrationAgent, userRequest);
  
  // The orchestration agent will automatically:
  // 1. Analyze the user request
  // 2. Determine which specialized agents are needed
  // 3. Hand off to appropriate agents in sequence
  // 4. Coordinate their responses
  // 5. Return a comprehensive workflow solution
  
  return result.finalOutput;
}

// Example usage
const workflowResult = await buildWorkflowWithAgents(
  "Create a customer onboarding workflow that integrates with Salesforce, " +
  "includes approval steps, and follows our company design guidelines"
);
```

## Integration with WorkflowHub

### 1. Chat Interface Integration

Extend the existing chat system in `app/components/chat/` to support multi-agent conversations:

```typescript
// app/lib/workflow/multi-agent-chat.ts
import { orchestrationAgent } from './agents';

export async function processWorkflowRequest(
  message: string,
  context: WorkflowContext
): Promise<WorkflowResponse> {
  const result = await run(orchestrationAgent, message);
  
  // Parse agent responses and update workflow state
  return {
    workflowCode: result.generatedCode,
    securityValidation: result.securityChecks,
    designGuidance: result.designRecommendations,
    integrationSetup: result.integrationConfig,
    qualityReport: result.codeReview
  };
}
```

### 2. Visual Builder Integration

Connect agents to the visual workflow builder in `app/components/workflows/builder/`:

```typescript
// app/components/workflows/builder/AgentOrchestrator.tsx
export function AgentOrchestrator({ onWorkflowUpdate }: Props) {
  const [agentStatus, setAgentStatus] = useState({
    security: 'idle',
    design: 'idle', 
    integration: 'idle',
    quality: 'idle'
  });

  const processWithAgents = async (userInput: string) => {
    setAgentStatus(prev => ({ ...prev, orchestration: 'active' }));
    
    const result = await buildWorkflowWithAgents(userInput);
    
    onWorkflowUpdate(result);
  };

  return (
    <div className="agent-orchestrator">
      <AgentStatusPanel status={agentStatus} />
      <ChatInterface onMessage={processWithAgents} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

### 3. Real-time Validation

Implement real-time agent validation during workflow building:

```typescript
// app/lib/workflow/real-time-validation.ts
export class RealTimeValidator {
  private agents: Map<string, Agent>;

  async validateInRealTime(
    workflowStep: WorkflowStep, 
    validationType: 'security' | 'design' | 'integration' | 'quality'
  ) {
    const agent = this.agents.get(validationType);
    if (!agent) return { valid: true };

    const result = await run(agent, `Validate this workflow step: ${JSON.stringify(workflowStep)}`);
    
    return {
      valid: result.finalOutput.includes('VALID'),
      issues: result.finalOutput.issues || [],
      suggestions: result.finalOutput.suggestions || []
    };
  }
}
```
