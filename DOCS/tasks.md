# WorkflowHub Development Tasks

## Project Overview

WorkflowHub is ~85% complete with a solid foundation of enterprise authentication, workflow execution engine, and working code generation. The platform successfully generates executable workflows using natural language, matching the PRD vision.

### Key Achievement
Successfully transformed Bolt.new from web development to workflow automation while maintaining the "magic" experience. The system generates real, executable Node.js workflows that run in the browser via WebContainer.

### Competitive Position vs Clark (Superblocks)
**Advantages**: Superior security granularity, complex workflow orchestration, broader integration potential (100+ via Arcade)
**Gaps**: Multi-agent architecture, runtime security validation, developer collaboration features
**Critical Need**: Match Clark's multi-agent approach and real-time permission validation
