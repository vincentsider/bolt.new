WorkflowHub – Product Requirements Document
1. Executive Summary
WorkflowHub is an enterprise‑grade, no‑code workflow and automation platform built for regulated financial‑services firms. Using a Lovable.dev‑style natural‑language builder, WorkflowHub lets non‑technical staff create, test, and deploy fully‑functioning, system‑integrated workflows in hours, not months. The platform delivers rapid cost savings, operational agility, and real‑time management information (MI) while meeting stringent security and compliance requirements.
“No code natural language workflow / automation tool enabling businesses to automate business processes in hours not months. “
2. Vision & Mission
Mission: Digitise and automate 80 % of manual processes for financial‑services businesses without writing code.


Vision: Become the default interoperability layer and workflow engine for offshore and mid‑market financial institutions globally.
3. Problem Statement
Financial‑services firms rely on fragmented, manual workflows that are:
Slow & Expensive – external dev cycles take months and cost six figures.


Rigid – hard‑coded processes cannot keep pace with regulatory change.


Siloed – core systems (CRM, entity management, screening, M365, finance) do not share data, forcing re‑keying.


Opaque – leadership lacks MI on status, bottlenecks, and resource load.


4. Objectives & Success Metrics

< 30 min simple WF; < 4 h complex WF
Increase automation coverage
50 % of manual processes in 6 mo
User adoption
